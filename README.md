# Backend_Assignment

In this Assignment I have to create an API endpoint which will accept the following data of a student:

Name: string,
Class: number,
Roll: AYW,
Student image: .jpg/.jpeg(size <= 1mb),
Identity[schoolId, aadhar, birthCertificate etc.]: pdf(size <= 1mb),
School Name: string,
District: string,
Postal Code: number

Then after that I save this data in the mongodb or json file.Also, I use multer for uploading student Image and Identity.
